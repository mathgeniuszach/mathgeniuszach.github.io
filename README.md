This is the front-end data for my website. It is closed source because I don't want someone to clone the Origin Creator and spew ads everywhere. Maybe when the Origin Creator goes down I'll open source it.

If you want to help with the Origin Creator, you can do so by reporting bugs on [my Discord](https://discord.gg/pBFqEcXvW5), or potentially make a change to the [Origin Creator schemas, which you can find here](https://github.com/xMGZx/origin-creator-schemas).
