        <h1>The Three Stages of Website Creation</h1>

        <p>As someone browsing my website, you might be curious how websites are created and put online.</p>
        <p>There are three main stages of website creation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Domain Registration</b><br>
                <span class="tabbed">Websites require a "domain" to connect to, like www.example.com or www.potato.com. Since everyone in the entire world is going to be able to connect to this website, the domain name needs to be uniquely registered in a public database that everyone can access. The domain uniquely points to a single given website. Some popular domain providers include <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="https://www.domain.com/">Domain.com</a>, but many online website creator tools can automatically provide you with a website domain/subdomain too.</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Server Hosting</b><br>
                <span class="tabbed">The content of any given website needs to be publicly available for people to view it. It is the job of a web server to "serve" the content of a website to anyone who connects to the website. Popular web server providers include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub Pages is what I used to host this website!</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Website Development</b><br>
                <span class="tabbed">Finally, websites need content to actually display. This can either be raw html/css/js code created by a programmer directly (like with this website) or content developed by a WYSIWYG editor like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver CC</a>. I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to write the code for this website.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>So there you have it. I'm glossing over a HUGE amount of detail here, but this is simple enough of an explanation for now. Website development is one of the most useful skills you can learn, so hopefully this webpage helped you learn at least some more about it!</p>
