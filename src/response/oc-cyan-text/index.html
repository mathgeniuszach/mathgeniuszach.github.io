            # Origins - Click Links

            I'm not entirely sure how people still miss this... but you can click [ANY CYAN TEXT](/response/oc-cyan-text) in the Origin Creator to learn more about the field you clicked on. You can also hover over ANY FIELD in the Origin Creator (regardless of color), and get a quick description of the field in a tooltip.
            
            This is most prevalent for the various "Type" fields scattered throughout the tool, which link you to the wiki and tell you exactly what all the possible values mean.
