            # Origins - Attributes

            The origins mod supports power types which modify minecraft [attributes](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Attribute). These are [origins:attribute](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.1/types/power_types/attribute/) and [origins:conditioned_attribute](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.1/types/power_types/conditioned_attribute/).

            Using attributes, you can modify a player's maximum health, knockback resistance, movement speed, attack damage, and a few other things. For example, the attribute "generic.max_health" for example will increase your maximum health. Just put the attribute id (like "generic.max_health") you want into the "attribute" field, choose an "operation", and then provide a value to apply the operation on. Test out different values and operations (or check the wiki) to see what they do in-game.

            Note that by default the origins:attribute power type does not support a condition. If you use one, it will be ignored. Use origins:conditioned_attribute instead if that's what you want.

            Also consider using [Pehkui](/response/oc-pehkui) if you want to modify something that isn't a default attribute modifier.
