            # Privacy Policy

            As of currently, this website does not collect or store any userdata. I also do not log any extra data through apps and games created independently by me either. However, Cloudflare does log IP addresses that visit this website for analytics, and other platforms I upload apps to (such as Google or Steam), may collect data automatically without my implicit control - for information about the data they collect, please see the respective privacy policy of those services.

            In the future, I may have accounts on this site, and I plan to only store details provided directly by users, such as login information, website savedata (such as Origin Creator savedata or webgame data), feedback, etc. This data will only be used to make the apps/games function or (in the case of feedback) used to know how to improve the apps/games I make. Please note, I'm not responsible if you make personal data available through any software I make.

            DISCLAIMER: This is not legal code; rather, it is meant to be a good-faith statement about how userdata ends up being used through software I make.

            If you have any concerns with this page or how your data is used, please shoot me at email at `mathgeniuszach at yahoo dot com`.
