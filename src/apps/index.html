            # Projects

            Hey! I'm mathgeniuszach, and over time I've put together various tools and mods for a variety of games and projects, I've worked on everything from web scraping and preservation to C# and Java modding. I like to hop around a lot between communities as things interest me here and there. If you have any neat ideas, let me know on my [Discord](//discord.gg/pBFqEcXvW5)!
