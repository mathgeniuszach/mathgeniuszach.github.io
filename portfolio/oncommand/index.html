On Command is a time attack arcade game based around the concept of following a list of seemingly simple rules such as &quot;Press Red&quot; or &quot;Avoid Near Red&quot; to determine which button on screen to tap or click. More and more rules will appear at once, making things more and more complicated and confusing as the game progresses.</p> <p>I have three goals for this project. First, this project is to act as a milestone marker in my academic career and ability. Second, I wanted to discuss some of the frustrations and benefits of technical writing. Thirdly, I wanted to work on a project with my siblings before I moved on to other things in life after college graduation.</p> <h2 id="initial-remarks">Initial Remarks</h2> <h3 id="the-idea-and-initial-planning-for-this-project-was-done-in-two-days-">The idea and initial planning for this project was done in two days.</h3> <p>Due to an unfortunate lack of communication between me and my professors, I initially didn&#39;t plan out my senior project during the summer like many other people did; instead, I was working on my other projects and also relaxing before my senior year hit me like a ton of bricks, which it did.</p> <p>This is my senior project. It&#39;s supposed to be the end-all-be-all of my academic career, yet I felt totally unprepared... except I definitely wasn&#39;t. All of my past experience working with previous projects and the Godot game engine, as well as the knowledge I gained from school projects invigorated me to be able to come up with an incredibly flexible yet addictive game idea at breakneck speed. The only difficulty was with the technical writing process, which while it was ultimately useful, did give me plenty of anxiety over potential requirements. Our professor was very hands-off, but after discussing requirements further and further the process eventually made more sense to me overall.</p> <h3 id="i-have-a-mixed-relationship-with-writing-">I have a mixed relationship with writing.</h3> <p>While I would consider myself a good writer, unless I&#39;m particularly passionate about the thing I&#39;m writing (and even then), writing is a drag. I don&#39;t like doing it, and if the writing is particularly intense I will mentally shut down. It&#39;s nearly happened to me a few times during this project, but I&#39;m much more able to handle the anxiety now than I was a few years ago.</p> <p>As a result, technical writing to me is a mixed bag. There&#39;s a lot of value in organizing your thoughts in written content, as well as communicating what you make and the feelings behind that development to other people. On the other hand, though, technical writing for me takes up a lot of extra time and energy - beyond what&#39;s necessary to complete it in the first place - that takes away from the actual projects themselves.</p> <h3 id="i-wanted-to-build-a-reaction-game-with-a-series-of-confusing-commands-the-player-has-to-interpret-">I wanted to build a reaction game with a series of confusing commands the player has to interpret.</h3> <p>I should also clarify that the initial idea for this project actually wasn&#39;t created in 2 days, only fleshed out in that time; I carry around with me quite a few random game ideas for potential implementation in the future, and this was one of those ideas.</p> <h3 id="project-development-is-split-into-four-distinct-milestones-spanning-about-a-month-each-">Project development is split into four distinct milestones spanning about a month each.</h3> <p>For this project there are four main milestones in which development occurs in a sprint-like fashion. My goal is to have </p> <p>On the end of the third milestone</p> <h2 id="first-milestone">First Milestone</h2> <p>My goal by the first milestone was to have the main portion of the game itself playable, while the interface, graphics, and overall look and feel may not be entirely complete. I also wanted it to be possible to pass in arbitrary attributes into the game to change possible rules and their effects, as well as the number of rounds - infinite for sandbox - that need to be completed in order to &quot;win&quot; a level.</p> <h2 id="more-coming-soon-">More Coming Soon...</h2> <p>There&#39;s still more to come. I&#39;m not done working on this project quite yet.</p></section><footer>Created by Zach K &nbsp; Theme:&nbsp; <select id="themer" onchange="changeTheme(this.value)"><option value="system">system</option><option value="light">light</option><option value="dark">dark</option></select><script>(()=>{let e=document.getElementById("themer");window.changeTheme=t=>{e.value=t,localStorage.setItem("theme",t),root=document.querySelector("html"),"light"==t?root.setAttribute("theme","light"):"dark"==t?root.setAttribute("theme","dark"):root.removeAttribute("theme"),window.onthemechange&&window.onthemechange()},changeTheme(localStorage.getItem("theme")??"system"),window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener("change",e=>{window.onthemechange&&window.onthemechange()})})();</script></footer></body></html>
