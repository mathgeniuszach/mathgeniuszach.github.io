On Command is a time attack arcade game based around the concept of following a list of seemingly simple rules such as &quot;Press Red&quot; or &quot;Avoid Near Red&quot; to determine which button on screen to tap or click. More and more rules will appear at once, making things more and more complicated and confusing as the game progresses.</p> <p>I have three goals for this project. First, this project is to act as a milestone marker in my academic career and ability. Second, I wanted to discuss some of the frustrations and benefits of technical writing. Thirdly, I wanted to work on a project with my siblings before I moved out after college graduation.</p> <h2 id="initial-remarks">Initial Remarks</h2> <h3 id="the-idea-and-initial-planning-for-this-project-was-done-in-two-days-">The idea and initial planning for this project was done in two days.</h3> <p>Due to an unfortunate lack of communication between me and my professors, I initially didn&#39;t plan out my senior project during the summer like many other people did; instead, I was working on my other projects and also relaxing before my senior year hit me like a ton of bricks, which it did.</p> <p>This is my senior project. It&#39;s supposed to be the end-all-be-all of my academic career, yet I felt totally unprepared... except I definitely wasn&#39;t. All of my past experience working with previous projects and the Godot game engine, as well as the knowledge I gained from school projects invigorated me to be able to come up with an incredibly flexible yet addictive game idea at breakneck speed. The only difficulty was with the technical writing process, which while it was ultimately useful, did give me plenty of anxiety over potential requirements. Our professor was very hands-off, but after discussing requirements further and further the process eventually made more sense to me overall.</p> <h3 id="i-have-a-mixed-relationship-with-writing-">I have a mixed relationship with writing.</h3> <p>While I would consider myself a good writer, unless I&#39;m particularly passionate about the thing I&#39;m writing (and even then), writing is a drag. I don&#39;t like doing it, and if the writing is particularly intense I will mentally shut down. It&#39;s nearly happened to me a few times during this project, but I&#39;m much more able to handle the anxiety now than I was a few years ago.</p> <p>As a result, technical writing to me is a mixed bag. There&#39;s a lot of value in organizing your thoughts in written content, as well as communicating what you make and the feelings behind that development to other people. On the other hand, though, technical writing for me takes up a lot of extra time and energy - beyond what&#39;s necessary to complete it in the first place - that takes away from the time I could be developing the actual projects themselves.</p> <h3 id="i-wanted-to-build-a-reaction-game-with-a-series-of-confusing-commands-the-player-has-to-interpret-">I wanted to build a reaction game with a series of confusing commands the player has to interpret.</h3> <p>I should also clarify that the initial idea for this project actually wasn&#39;t created in 2 days, only fleshed out in that time; I carry around with me quite a few random game ideas for potential implementation in the future, and this was one of those ideas. I only had a basic concept, but through the first two days of my class I fully fleshed it out; I wanted it to be a mobile-like game with a simple set of rules, a grid of buttons, and distinct levels of progressing difficulty throughout.</p> <p>As for the creative design of the game, it should be of a semi-dark color scheme with a slightly brighter glow and contrast on buttons. Each screen has a single background color that fades into other colors when switching screens. Buttons and options are fairly large and iconic, and interfaces are as free from as much visual clutter as possible.</p> <p>As for the technical design of the game, it should be split into a few menu scenes and the playable game scene. The menus will persist of a main menu, sandbox configuration menu, and level select. There is also always a gear to configure game volume and effects in the top right of the screen. The game scene as a number of &quot;rounds&quot; that require pressing one correct button to progress through - the correct button can be consistently determined using the rules specified. After completing a certain number of rounds (in a level), or gaining three strikes (in a level and endless mode), the game will end, either displaying a &quot;You Win&quot; or a &quot;Game Over&quot; message, as well as providing a means of going back to the main menu.</p> <p>The target audience is the general public with access to the internet with a logical pointer (that of a touchscreen device or computer mouse), specifically those who can interact with visual cues and follow logical rules fairly quickly.</p> <h3 id="project-development-is-split-into-two-sets-of-four-distinct-milestones-spanning-about-a-month-each-">Project development is split into two sets of four distinct milestones spanning about a month each.</h3> <p>For this project there are four main milestones in which development occurs in a sprint-like fashion. My goal is to have the main portion of the game scene itself complete by the first milestone (creating a prototype), the menus complete by the second milestone (creating a vertical slice), fleshing out dozens of levels by the third milestone (creating a alpha), and fleshing out any bugs and adding polish in the fourth milestone (creating at least a beta).</p> <p>I also have another semester after winter break with an additional four milestones, which are not currently fleshed out because I&#39;m not sure if I want to expand out this game or create another separate game with that time.</p> <h2 id="first-milestone">First Milestone</h2> <p>My goal by the first milestone was to have the main portion of the game itself playable, while the interface, graphics, and overall look and feel may not be entirely complete. I also wanted it to be possible to pass in arbitrary attributes into the game to change possible rules and their effects, as well as the number of rounds - infinite for sandbox - that need to be completed in order to &quot;win&quot; a level. By this point in time a &quot;prototype&quot; will be complete showcasing what it&#39;s like to play a level fully or in endless mode.</p> <h3 id="despite-hiccups-during-the-first-week-or-two-of-development-i-still-ended-up-ahead-of-schedule-">Despite hiccups during the first week or two of development, I still ended up ahead of schedule.</h3> <p>During the first two weeks of development, I developed a very painful ear infection that prevented me from being able to work on the game as much as I had desired. Nevertheless, I had planned for extraneous circumstances like this. I had designed this game idea to be flexible and expansive so I could add as much or as little content as I wanted, and gave myself both realistic deadlines and plenty of development time.</p> <p>On top of all of that, I managed to find the time to implement many more visual features than I initially had planned. Buttons have rounded corners and shadows instead of being placeholder assets, rules are shown in differing colors, dozens of colors and symbols are supported, the board can be any size from 2x2 to 10x10, a &quot;Find Any&quot; starting screen was implemented to determine when the player is ready to begin, correct answers now flash for a brief amount of time after pressing a button or running out of time, and the game is dpi-aware. I initially planned on just being able to implement a simple interface, but the assets are not just placeholder assets anymore - while they still can be replaced, they&#39;re also suitable to the art style and welcome to stay until the game is complete.</p> <p>Additionally, while I was only planning on creating a Windows and Linux build initially, I succeeded in creating both an Android and web build as well. These can all be downloaded and played from <a href="https://mathgeniuszach.itch.io/on-command">the itch.io page</a>.</p> <h3 id="ultimately-i-m-happy-with-how-the-game-turned-out-so-far-">Ultimately, I&#39;m happy with how the game turned out so far.</h3> <p>The only goal I haven&#39;t been able to fully meet during this milestone was working with my siblings on this game. I sent them some messages introducing them to the project, but haven&#39;t provided any direction as of yet. I was only able to complete my goal of discussing technical writing through this portfolio content at the very start of the second milestone, when I started writing this portfolio page.</p> <p>Ultimately, the game content speaks for itself; the loop is quite addictive and enjoyable. I particularly like the transitional phases between rounds that reveal correct answers. More discussion with my siblings is necessary for the upcoming milestones.</p> <h3 id="here-s-a-showcase-of-the-first-prototype-of-the-game-">Here&#39;s a showcase of the first prototype of the game.</h3> <p><img src="/i/on-command-1.gif" alt="Showcase First Milestone"></p> <h2 id="more-coming-soon-">More Coming Soon...</h2> <p>There&#39;s still more to come. I&#39;m not done working on this project quite yet.</p></section><footer>Created by Zach K &nbsp; Theme:&nbsp; <select id="themer" onchange="changeTheme(this.value)"><option value="system">system</option><option value="light">light</option><option value="dark">dark</option></select><script>(()=>{let e=document.getElementById("themer");window.changeTheme=t=>{e.value=t,localStorage.setItem("theme",t),root=document.querySelector("html"),"light"==t?root.setAttribute("theme","light"):"dark"==t?root.setAttribute("theme","dark"):root.removeAttribute("theme"),window.onthemechange&&window.onthemechange()},changeTheme(localStorage.getItem("theme")??"system"),window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").addEventListener("change",e=>{window.onthemechange&&window.onthemechange()})})();</script></footer></body></html>
