        <h1>Origin Creator</h1>
        <div class="content" id="div-help">
            <p>This is a tool for creating custom Origins for the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins</a> mod in Minecraft.</p>
            
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>You can click the "Help" button in the top left to return to this page at any time.</p>
            
            <p>Before editing anything, you should add metadata to your work so people know it was you who made it. You can do this by clicking the "Metadata" item in the left box. This help page will then be replaced by an editor for metadata, and most of the entries in the editor are self-explanitory.</p>
            
            <p>If you already have a datapack or mod you want to edit, press the "Import" button in the bottom left and select the item you want to edit on your Computer.</p>
            
            <p>After adding metadata, you can add data items by using the "Layer", "Origin", and "Power" buttons at the bottom left of the page. After adding anything, click on it in the left box to select and edit it. Whatever page you are on will then be replaced by an editor for that item. You can also press the "Delete" button to delete the item you have selected (other than the "Metadata" item), or the "Reset" button to delete all your progress and return to this page.</p>
            
            <p>When you are finished editing, you can press the "Datapack" button to export your work to a datapack or the "Mod" button to export it to a mod. </p>
            
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Creating a good origin can be difficult, so here's a few tips.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you aren't sure what something does, hover over the label. A tooltip will provide a short description of what that entry is for.</li>
                <li>This page auto-saves to a cookie on your computer everytime a field loses focus, so refreshing or closing the page won't lose your progress. There's a save button in the bottom left too if you feel unsure. If you want to remove your progress and delete the cookie, press "Reset."</li>
                <li>IDs can be specified without a namespace. On export, these will be namespaced with your pack's id, not "origins".</li>
                <li>Lists, when added, take on all of the properties of the fields below them; therefore, it's good to type in a name/id for the field first, then press the add button. Lists will also autosave to whatever is selected, and will switch fields when a new item is selected.</li>
                <li>Check out the official <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki">wiki</a> for more information on what each thing does.</li>
                <li>Check out the #origin-ideas chat in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3"> Origins Discord</a></li>
                <li>Test things out! If you aren't sure something will work, test it out in Minecraft! Failure is an important step in creativity.</li>
                <li>
                    Here are some good design principles to make origins/powers interesting:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simple</b> - A good origin is easy to understand and doesn't have too many powers. Staying under six is a good idea and helps you make the most of each power. You can get around this by grouping powers together (e.g., if you can't touch water, this includes both water and rain).</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Unique</b> - An origin should provide a gameplay experience and look and feel unique to itself. Copying a different origin in a slightly different way can get dull and old. This doesn't mean you can't take inspiration from places like mobs or other people's origins, it just means that people should be able to get a special experience using your origin.</li> 
                        
                        <li><b>Inspiring</b> - A good origin enables you to be creative with how you play the game, even if it's in a small way. Take for example the Merling; you must play underwater for most of the game, which requires the player to concoct new and interesting ways of doing things that would've been simple without the origin (e.g., how do you survive in the Nether?). You don't have to have a high-impact origin to do this (consider the Avian)</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Balanced</b> - A good origin provides a good balance of power and disabilities. Making something too difficult (like having only half a heart) is only fun for a very small amount of people, and giving an origin too much power can take away the challenge that people also enjoy.</li>
                        
                        <li><b>Fun</b> - A good origin provides a fun/challenging experience to a large subset of players. The definition of "Fun" depends on the person, but normally you can use common sense</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
