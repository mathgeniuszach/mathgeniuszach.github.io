        <h1>Origin Creator</h1>
        <div class="content" id="div-help">
            <p>This is a work-in-progress tool for creating custom Origins for the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins</a> mod in Minecraft.</p>
            
            <p>Note that there may be bugs and performance issues (second-long loading times). I'm honestly just trying to get the thing working right now rather than worring about performance. Report any bugs <a href="https://github.com/xMGZx/xmgzx.github.io/issues">here</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>You can click the "Help" button in the top left to return to this page at any time.</p>
            
            <p>Before editing anything, you should add metadata to your work so people know it was you who made it. You can do this by clicking the "Metadata" item in the left box. This help page will then be replaced by an editor for metadata, and most of the entries in the editor are self-explanitory.</p>
            
            <p>If you already have a datapack or mod you want to edit, press the "Import" button in the bottom left and select the item you want to edit on your Computer. Note that this button will <i>merge</i> all of the content from that item into your workspace, replacing anything that it can.</p>
            
            <p>After adding metadata, you can add data items by using the "+" option beneath one of the groups at the left of the page. After adding anything, it should select and open up an editor for that item. You can switch between items by clicking them in the left pane. You can also press the "Delete" button to delete the item you have selected, or the "Reset" button to delete all your progress and return to this page. One thing to note, if you are adding a <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag">tag</a>, <i>MAKE SURE</i> you rename it to include at least one folder, otherwise minecraft will not detect it's type.</p>
            
            <p>For information, here's what each of the different grouped items are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Defining-an-origin-in-JSON">Layers</a><br><span class="tabbed">Layers are groups of origins. Usually you will only need to use the origins:origin layer to enable people to select your origin when they first join a world. You can also make your own layers if you want to do additional things like <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Origin-conditions-in-layers">coniditional origins</a>.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Defining-an-origin-in-JSON">Origins</a><br><span class="tabbed">Groups of powers that people can have and/or choose from, like the Blazeborn or the Enderian on the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins homepage</a>.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Defining-a-power-in-JSON">Powers</a><br><span class="tabbed">Abilities and Disabilities that origins can have. They are very versitile.</span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you are finished editing, you can press the "To Datapack" button to export your work to a datapack or the "To Mod" button to export it to a mod. </p>
            
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Creating a good origin can be difficult, so here's a few tips.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you aren't sure what something does, hover over the label. A tooltip will provide a short description of what that entry is for.</li>
                <li>This page auto-saves on your computer everytime a field loses focus, so refreshing or closing the page won't lose your progress. There's a save button in the top left too if you feel unsure. If you want to reset the pack back do it's default state, press "Reset".</li>
                <li>Pressing the "+" button in any subpanel will add content to that panel and change the button to a "-" button. Pressing this new button will remove any content (and data stored) in that panel.</li>
                <li>Want to save multiple projects? Click the "Raw Data" button, type anything into the "Save" box, and press the "Load" button to the bottom right. The page will be reloaded and you will store data in a separate location.</li>
                <li>Check out the official <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki">wiki</a> for more information on what each thing does.</li>
                <li>Check out the #origin-ideas chat in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3"> Origins Discord</a></li>
                <li>Test things out! If you aren't sure something will work, test it out in Minecraft! Failure is an important step in creativity.</li>
                <li>
                    Here are some good design principles to make origins/powers interesting:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simple</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin is easy to understand and doesn't have too many powers. Staying under six is a good idea and helps you make the most of each power. You can get around this by grouping powers together (e.g., if you can't touch water, this includes both water and rain).</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Unique</b><br><span class="tabbed">An origin should provide a gameplay experience and look and feel unique to itself. Copying a different origin in a slightly different way can get dull and old. This doesn't mean you can't take inspiration from places like mobs or other people's origins, it just means that people should be able to get a special experience using your origin.</span></li> 
                        
                        <li><b>Inspiring</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin enables you to be creative with how you play the game, even if it's in a small way. Take for example the Merling; you must play underwater for most of the game, which requires the player to concoct new and interesting ways of doing things that would've been simple without the origin (e.g., how do you survive in the Nether?). You don't have to have a high-impact origin to do this (consider the Avian)</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Balanced</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin provides a good balance of power and disabilities. Making something too difficult (like having only half a heart) is only fun for a very small amount of people, and giving an origin too much power can take away the challenge that people also enjoy.</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Fun</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin provides a fun/challenging experience to a large subset of players. The definition of "Fun" depends on the person, but normally you can use common sense</span></li>
                    </ul>
