        <h1>Origin Creator</h1>
        <div class="content" id="div-help">
            <p>This is a tool for creating custom <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack">datapacks</a> for Minecraft in a more visual manner. <span class="non-simple">It also mainly supports the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins</a> mod.</span></p>
            <p>There may be bugs and performance issues (second-long loading times).</p>
            <p>Join my <a href="https://discord.gg/pBFqEcXvW5">Discord</a> if you want to talk about the tool or some of my other projects.</p>
            
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>You can click the "Help" button in the top left to return to this page at any time.</p>
            
            <p>Before editing anything, you should add metadata to your work so people know it was you who made it. You can do this by clicking the "meta" item in the left box. This help page will then be replaced by an editor for metadata, and most of the entries in the editor are self-explanitory. If you don't understand something, you can hover over the label to the left of the entry box to view a quick description of that field. Blue labels you can also click on.</p>
            
            <p>If you already have a datapack or mod you want to edit, press the "Import" button in the bottom left and select the item you want to edit on your Computer. You can also press the "Merge" button if you want to merge any datapack with your own without modifying metadata. Note that merging any datapack into your workspace will overwrite any files already being used (so be careful about the "minecraft:tick" and "minecraft:load" tags<span class="non-simple">, or the "origins:origin" layer</span>).</p>
            
            <p>After adding metadata, you can add anything to the datapack by right clicking on any group or folder in the left pane and clicking "New File" (or if you want to make a folder, "New Folder"). Items may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores in their name.</p>

            <p>Item names can optionally specify a namespace and/or a file extension in the format "namespace:name.ext". If a namespace is not found, it will default to whatever your pack's id is (e.g., "thing.json" becomes "mypack:thing.json"). If the file extention is not found on export, it will default to .json or .mcfunction (e.g., "thing" becomes "mypack:thing.json" or "mypack:thing.mcfunction"). Folders are considered too (e.g., "pack:thing.json" in the "folder" folder becomes "pack:folder/thing.json").</p>

            <p>After adding anything, click on it to open up an editor for that item; you can switch between editors of different items by clicking them in the left pane. Right clicking any item in the left pane provides you the option to delete, cut, copy, and paste it anywhere. You can also pick up any added items and drag them around in the left pane to move them.</p>
            
            <p>For information, here's what each of the different groups are:</p>
            <ul>

Usually you will only need to use the origins:origin layer to enable people to select your origin when they first join a world. You can also make your own layers if you want to do additional things like <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Origin-conditions-in-layers">conditional origins</a>.</span></li>

                <li class="non-simple"><a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki/Defining-a-power-in-JSON">Powers</a><br><span class="tabbed">Abilities and Disabilities that origins can have. They are very versitile.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag">Tags</a><br><span class="tabbed">Lists of things. Note that any tag you create must be located in one of the predefined folders so minecraft knows the type of tag it is.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Function_(Java_Edition)">Functions</a><br><span class="tabbed">Files containing a sequence of minecraft commands to run in order.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Predicate">Predicates</a><br><span class="tabbed">Data-driven conditions that the <code>/execute if</code> command can check for.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Recipe">Recipes</a><br><span class="tabbed">Custom crafting recipes for a variety of crafting blocks. Because the format is complex, the editor isn't as visual. Check out <a href="https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/">this</a> tool to create a recipe in a more visual way. You can load individual recipes simply by pressing the "Toggle Raw" button at the top of an already created recipe, pasting the json code in there, and pressing "Save Raw".</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table">Loot Tables</a><br><span class="tabbed">Data structures storing how everything from how dungeon chests are generated to how mobs drop loot.</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Advancement/JSON_format">Advancements</a><br><span class="tabbed">Goals the player can attempt to reach. Since most of the format is a bit complex, this editor isn't as visual. Check out <a href="https://advancements.thedestruc7i0n.ca/">this</a> tool to create a bunch of advancements in a more visual way. You can merge any exported datapack (instead of importing it) to include them in your pack.</span></li>
                <li>Data Scripts<br><span class="tabbed">An unfinished programming language for creating mcfunctions and other files easier. This is just a teaser for now, and I don't know when it will be ready!</span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When you are finished editing, you can press the "To Datapack" button to export your work to a datapack or the "To Mod" button to export it to a mod. Note that empty folders will not be exported.</p>
            
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Creating a good origin can be difficult, so here's a few tips.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you aren't sure what something does, hover over the label. A tooltip will provide a short description of what that entry is for.</li>
                <li>This page auto-saves on your computer everytime a field loses focus, so refreshing or closing the page won't lose your progress. There's a save button in the top left too if you feel unsure. If you want to reset the pack back do it's default state, press "Reset".</li>
                <li>Pressing the "+" button in any subpanel will add content to that panel and change the button to a "-" button. Pressing this new button will remove any content (and data stored) in that panel.</li>
                <li>Want to save multiple projects? Click the "Raw Data" button, type anything into the "Save" box, and press the "Load" button to the bottom right. The page will be reloaded and you will store data in a separate location. The default save location is available if you put nothing in the save box and press "Load".</li>
                <li class="non-simple">Check out the official <a href="https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric/wiki">wiki</a> for more information on what each thing in the Origins mod does.</li>
                <li class="non-simple">Check out the #origin-ideas chat in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3"> Origins Discord.</a></li>
                <li class="non-simple">Test things out! If you aren't sure something will work, test it out in Minecraft! Failure is an important step in creativity.</li>
                <li class="non-simple">
                    Here are some good design principles to make origins/powers interesting:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simple</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin is easy to understand and doesn't have too many powers. Staying under six is a good idea and helps you make the most of each power. You can get around this by grouping powers together (e.g., if you can't touch water, this includes both water and rain).</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Unique</b><br><span class="tabbed">An origin should provide a gameplay experience and look and feel unique to itself. Copying a different origin in a slightly different way can get dull and old. This doesn't mean you can't take inspiration from places like mobs or other people's origins, it just means that people should be able to get a special experience using your origin.</span></li> 
                        
                        <li><b>Inspiring</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin enables you to be creative with how you play the game, even if it's in a small way. Take for example the Merling; you must play underwater for most of the game, which requires the player to concoct new and interesting ways of doing things that would've been simple without the origin (e.g., how do you survive in the Nether?). You don't have to have a high-impact origin to do this (consider the Avian)</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Balanced</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin provides a good balance of power and disabilities. Making something too difficult (like having only half a heart) is only fun for a very small amount of people, and giving an origin too much power can take away the challenge that people also enjoy.</span></li>
                        
                        <li><b>Fun</b><br><span class="tabbed">A good origin provides a fun/challenging experience to a large subset of players. The definition of "Fun" depends on the person, but normally you can use common sense</span></li>
