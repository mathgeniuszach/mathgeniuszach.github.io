Help</strong> button to get to this page at any time.</p> <p>This is a tool for creating custom <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack">datapacks</a> for Minecraft in a more visual manner. It also mainly supports the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins">Origins</a> mod.</p> <p>For the knuckleheads who want to ask questions about making Origins, do NOT ask in my Discord, ask instead in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3">Origins Discord</a> server. You&#39;re more likely to get a useful answer there UNLESS you are actually having an issue with a bug in my own tool (in that case use the below link).</p> <p>I just recently rewrote the entire tool from scratch, so there may be bugs or performance issues. If you have a problem with using the tool or a bug to report, PLEASE do so in my <a href="https://discord.gg/pBFqEcXvW5">Discord</a> server.</p> <h2 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h2> <p>The Origin Creator autosaves your work every time you make a change to some element on the page, so no need to worry about manually saving anything. Just be careful about clearing your browser cache (not browsing history), which may delete all your projects. There is a button you can use to download and import all projects as a single file if you so need it.</p> <p>The sidebar on the left displays the name of the current project you&#39;re working on, provides access to project files you can click on, and gives you access to quite a few buttons:</p> <ul> <li>&#xf3d7; <strong>Projects</strong> <em>Use this button to switch save slots or view the way the datapack is stored internally.</em></li> <li>&#xf2ec; <strong>Project Data</strong> <em>Use this button to swap back to whatever file you were working on before clicking one of the other two buttons. You can also just click a file in the left file tree to work on it.</em></li> <li>&nbsp;? <strong>Help</strong> <em>This is the screen you are currently on. It provides many useful tidbits of information on how to use the tool.</em></li> <li>&#xf3d3; <strong>Add Type</strong> <em>This adds a root folder to your project. You can use it to re-add folders that were deleted (for example, if you delete the recipes folder). Known types will gain an icon.</em></li> <li>&#xf37d; <strong>Import</strong> <em>Press this button and select a file to upload to be included in your datapack. If the file itself is a datapack, it will be merged with your current pack.</em></li> <li>&#xf30a; <strong>Export</strong> <em>Use this button to download the entire datapack. You may optionally choose to export as a mod instead of a zip file and specify a mod loader.</em></li> <li>&#xf117; <strong>Reset</strong> <em>This button will open up a menu which you can use to reset the pack or initialize it for the first time.</em></li> </ul> <p>To initalize your first project, click the &#xf117; <strong>Reset</strong> button, choose whether you are working on a vanilla datapack or an origins datapack, and put in a name and version number for the project. After clicking apply, the project tree will immediately be populated with folders you&#39;ll use for the datapack. </p> <p>If you have a project you want to import and edit instead of working from scratch, you can press the &#xf37d; <strong>Import</strong> button and select that datapack instead.</p> <p>From this point, you can right click any folder in the file tree and click <strong>New File</strong> or <strong>New Folder</strong> to add that respective item. Items may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores in their name.</p> <p>Item names can optionally specify a namespace and/or a file extension in the format &quot;namespace:name.ext&quot;. If a namespace is not found, it will default to whatever your pack&#39;s id is (e.g., &quot;thing.json&quot; becomes &quot;mypack:thing.json&quot;). If the file extention is not found on export, it will default to .json or .mcfunction (e.g., &quot;thing&quot; becomes &quot;mypack:thing.json&quot; or &quot;mypack:thing.mcfunction&quot;). Folders are considered too (e.g., &quot;pack:thing.json&quot; in the &quot;folder&quot; folder becomes &quot;pack:folder/thing.json&quot;).</p> <p>After adding anything, click on it to open up an editor for that item; you can switch between editors of different items by clicking them in the left pane. Right clicking any item in the left pane provides you the option to delete, cut, copy, and paste it anywhere. You can also pick up any added items and drag them around in the left pane to move them.</p> <p>Note that when editing files, if you do not specify a namespace for a specific field, it will either default to &quot;minecraft&quot; (for vanilla things like items, blocks, entities, recipes, advancements, etc), or &quot;0&quot; (which means your own pack&#39;s ID). You can always use 0 as the namespace to refer to your own pack&#39;s ID.</p> <p>When you are finished editing, you can press the &#xf30a; <strong>Export</strong> button to export your work to a datapack or to a mod. Note that empty folders will not be exported.</p> <p>For more information, here&#39;s what each of the different default folders in the left are for (you can click on their names to view the wiki):</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layer_json/">Origin Layers</a> - <a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.3/layer_json/">1.16 alt</a> <em>For the Origins mod. Layers are groups of origins. Usually you will only need to use the origins:origin layer to enable people to select your origin when they first join a world. You can also make your own layers if you want to do additional things like <a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/data/origin_conditions_in_layers/">conditional origins</a>.</em></li> <li><a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/origin_json/">Origins</a> - <a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.3/origin_json/">1.16 alt</a> <em>For the Origins mod.

You can import any exported datapack to include them in your pack.</em></li> </ul> <h2 id="tips-and-info">Tips and Info</h2> <p>Most options and details are self explanitory, though there are a few details about the tool you might not know about:</p> <ul> <li>If you aren&#39;t sure what some field does, hover over the label. A tooltip will provide a short description of what that entry is for.</li> <li>You can select any panel and use the Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V shortcuts to cut, copy, and paste the data in that panel and move it around.</li> <li>The creator auto-saves on your computer everytime a field loses focus, so refreshing or closing the page won&#39;t lose your progress.</li> <li>Pressing the &quot;+&quot; button in any subpanel will add content to that panel and change the button to a &quot;-&quot; button. Pressing this new button will remove any content (and data stored) in that panel.</li> <li>Check out the <a href="https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">official Origins wiki</a> for more information on what each thing in the Origins mod does.</li> <li>Test things out! If you aren&#39;t sure something will work, test it out in Minecraft! Failure is an important step in creativity.</li> <li>Here are some good design principles to make origins/powers interesting:<ul> <li><strong>Simple</strong> <em>A good origin is easy to understand and doesn&#39;t have too many powers. Staying under six is a good idea and helps you make the most of each power. You can get around this by grouping powers together (e.g., if you can&#39;t touch water, this includes both water and rain).</em></li> <li><strong>Unique</strong> <em>An origin should provide a gameplay experience and look and feel unique to itself. Copying a different origin in a slightly different way can get dull and old. This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t take inspiration from places like mobs or other people&#39;s origins, it just means that people should be able to get a special experience using your origin.</em></li> <li><strong>Inspiring</strong> <em>A good origin enables you to be creative with how you play the game, even if it&#39;s in a small way. Take for example the Merling; you must play underwater for most of the game, which requires the player to concoct new and interesting ways of doing things that would&#39;ve been simple without the origin (e.g., how do you survive in the Nether?). You don&#39;t have to have a high-impact origin to do this (consider the Avian).</em></li> <li><strong>Balanced</strong> <em>A good origin provides a good balance of power and disabilities. Making something too difficult (like having only half a heart) is only fun for a very small amount of people, and giving an origin too much power can take away the challenge that people also enjoy.</em></li> <li><strong>Fun</strong> <em>A good origin provides a fun/challenging experience to a large subset of players. The definition of &quot;Fun&quot; depends on the person, but normally you can use common sense to infer what people find fun or not.</em></li> </ul> </li> </ul></div></section><footer>Created by Zach K</footer></body></html>
