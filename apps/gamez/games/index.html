<p>Welcome to <b>GameZ</b>, A neat little bloat-free multiplayer place for playing games with your friends.</p>
<p>To invite people to your lobby, press the "Copy Invite Link" button on the left of the screen and send the link with whoever. You or anyone else can change their name using the "Name" field on the left side.</p>
<p class="mobile">On mobile devices, you can click the "+" button on the top left or right to open the player list or chat.</p>
<p>At any point in time, you (as the host) can also click on someone's name to kick or ban them from the lobby. Unbanning people is not possible without making a new lobby, so be careful.</p>
<p>Once you have some people in your lobby, you (as the host) can click on the title of one of the games below to start it. People can also join mid-game as spectators.</p>
